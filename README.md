# CuteCakesByBronaghMS1

## First Milestone project for Code Institute by Lorna Clarke. 

### User Experience:
===================

My project is to build a website for small business Cute Cakes by Bronagh. 
Bronagh runs her business from her kitchen/studio on a small scale selling her cakes directly to customers. 
Each cake is carefully prepared and decorated in accordance to customer’s specifications and all health and safety criteria.
Bronagh runs her business solo, along-side her full-time job, this means Bronagh needs her website to do a little work on her behalf;    
A visually pleasing and easy to use website that will showcase her work and entice customers to book her for their cake needs.    

* There will be a gallery area presenting some of Bronagh’s most impressive and popular cakes.
* Bronagh runs seasonal cakes on holidays such as Christmas, Valentine's Day, Halloween, Communion/Confirmation season etc. 
  These cakes are to be showcased on a modal when the website loads, encouraging customers to order while there is still availability. 
* A menu section where Bronagh lists the types of cakes and icings she uses.
* Bronagh would like to omit pricing from the website as it very much varies on a cake to cake basis, depending on: number of people to feed, 
   filling, icing, sponge/chocolate biscuit cake and details such as hand made characters and accents. Leaving pricing off the website not only 
   ensures that customers aren’t expecting one price and disappointed when they are potentially quoted something higher, 
   but it also creates an opportunity for Bronagh to work within someone’s budget as a customer could potentially be put off purchasing by seeing a price that
   is outside of their budget.
* A FAQ section where there will be answers to Bronagh’s most asked questions to reduce the amount of general queries in her inbox.
* A reviews section of past customers to assure potential buyers they are getting a high quality product.
* A calendar section where customers can see Bronagh’s availability as a means to reduce the amount of emails she will have to respond to informing 
   customers she is fully booked.
* The calendar will also be colour coded into three levels “Spaces Available”, “Some Spaced Available” and “Fully Booked”.
   Bronagh will be able to update this herself so that she may work her bookings into her busy schedule easily. 
* A clear and easy to use contact form where customers can make a selection of “book a consultation” to book a meeting for large events 
   such as weddings, also “make a booking” for oderers such as seasonal offerings and "general query" to answer any potential questions
   not covered in the website. These messages will be sent to Bronagh’s email and they will also arrive to her account marked as important. 
* Links to social media so that customers may peruse her work and follow her on her various platforms.
* Contact and location details so that customers may easily find Bronagh’s studio where she hosts consultations and is also a collection point.    

*User story*    

Bronagh’s customer base consists primarily of people living in the Celbridge/Lucan/Leixlip/Maynooth areas and she also provides cake delivery for these areas. 
Organising delivery or collection specification will not be available on the website as this is organised on a client to client basis depending 
on their needs and Bronagh’s schedule. 
Bronagh’s skills, qualifications and the extent to which she can customise cakes sets her aside from other bakeries in the area. 
Although there are other independent cake makers in the area many of Bronagh’s customers have been coming to her for years, 
she has gathered enough repeat custom that within her schedule that she is always busy.

 Bronagh’s client base is primarily made up of Women from the ages of late 20s to 50+. 
 With this in mind I will be keeping the design of the website as straight forward and uncluttered as possible, 
 while also keeping in mind mobile first principles. For the majority of interactions Bronagh would like to keep them either via mail 
 or in person as she would like to keep her personal details private and contact from customers to come in on one platform for simplicity.  
 I will use a relatively linear and easy to navigate hierarchical structure, keeping in mind the order of the cake booking process .ie 
 the opening page information, looking at work, perusing the menu, answering general queries, seeing if there is availability at the time of the event, 
 making contact. I hope to create a site that not only showcases the products but is intuitive for any potential customer/collaborator to use.
